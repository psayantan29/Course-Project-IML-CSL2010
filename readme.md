Empirical Analysis Of The General Utility Problem In Machine Learning

This paper gives the proof of omnipresence of General utility problem across various domains in Machine learning.

Across various methods and models namely Neural networks, set covering method, MBAC model,PlSI method etc.

General utility problem refers to the gradual reduction of performance after attainment of peak as performance the amount of learned knowledge increases.
